      <h3>The Pokestops</h3>
      <p> Pokestops are one of the most important things in the game. You click on the stop and spin the disc. It turns purple once it is spun. You get different supplies at each stop. The most common things to get are eggs(when you have space), balls, potions, and revives. </p>

      <h3>Battling and Defending Gyms</h3>
      <p>Battling gyms allows you to put your pokemon into gyms. You will first click on the gym that is not your team color. Then, you will click the battle button. To battle, you simply tap on the screen. Once you have batteled the gym to create a new gym, click the add button now your pokemon is located inside. If you don't want to battle, you can find a gym with an empty slot. Then, go to the gym and add your pokemon. Feed your pokeon berries for it to defend longer. You get 1 PokeCoin for every 10 minutes you defend in the gym. If someone is battling your gym, you won't be able to add your pokemon in the gym. </p>

 <h3>Friends</h3>
 <p>In Pokemon Go, you are allowed to add friends. With this feature, you can trade pokemon with each other and send gifts to each other. You can add people by scanning their QR code or adding them by their friend code. Once you are freinds, you can level up your friendship by sending gifts, trading, and raids. You can give gifts by getting them from pokestops. You get gifts by opening them from your friends. Trading pokemon is also another good feature. You are able to get a <strong>lucky</strong> pokemon by trading. Lucky pokemon are hard to get. </p>

 <h3>Raids</h3>
 <p> Another fun friend activity in Pokemon Go is raids. There are 5 levels of the raids, level one to level five. Level five is the legendary raid boss. In order to defeat it, you need a group of people to take it down. When raiding with friends, you are allowed to level up your friendship. If you defeat the raid boss, then you and the other players have a chance to catch the raid boss and it is not guaranteed. Good Luck!!! </p>
