<p class= "text">Almost all pokemon have something called an evolution, which means that the pokemon can evolve into something different. For example, a pokemon like Bulbasuar evolves into Ivysuar. Ivysuar later evolves into Venasuar. Pokemon GO has this feature. When you catch enough pokemon, yuo will get enough candies. You will be able to evolve your pokemon.  </p>

  <p>Pidgey is the first evolution of the three pokemon. In pokemon go, you need a certain amount of candies to evolve it. Some pokemon need a special item to evolve. You can get these special items by many different ways. </p>
